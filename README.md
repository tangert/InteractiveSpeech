Experiments using SpeechKit to try to adjust font size based on audio input in speech to text conversion.

This is a small app I built over the weekend that uses your audio input (first read as Decibels, then converted into an amplitude between 0 and 1), and converts that input into an appropriate font size.

This is mainly trying to see if we can understand a greater context of converted speech-to-text than just the text itself; in this case, adjusting font size based on input volume could represent a metric for expressiveness or intensity. I'm working on graphing the results and seeing if it has any mathemetical implications towards advancing NLP.
